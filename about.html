    E.B.Dalton is a writer, weightlifter and foul-mouthed knitter
    living in Richmond, Virginia, under a willow oak tree
    controlled by the squirrel mafia. Send nuts.
    <br>
    <br>
    She writes speculative fiction short stories and is working on her
    first novel, set on a luxury hotel orbiting
    earth. She is also founder of a spec-fic writing group that hogs
    tables at cafe write-ins, bakes rejection cookies
    and sneaks off to the beach every summer.
    <br>
    <br>
    She is a graduate of the University of Virginia, an ordained minister
    and a big fan of James River Writers, in
    reverse order of utility.
